### Topic : Database Users and Database Administrators
---

On the first flipped class of DBS101, I learned about the roles of different types of database users and the responsibilities of database administrators. There are 7 database users. Naive users, they donâ€™t have the key knowledge about DBMS but to get the desired result, they use database applications. System Analyst, they analyze and improve the systems involved in managing the database. Sophisticated Users , individuals who have advanced knowledge and skills of DBMS being used. Database designers, the key player in development and maintenance of database. Application programmers, the computer professionals who write program applications. Casual users, communicates with the database for little period of time. And the specialised users, writes specialised database application. We learned that DBA manages the database, stores and organise data and they ensures that databases are secure and working effectively.  Also, we learned that DBA is responsible for task like designing and optimizing performance.

Before the flipped class, I read the reading materials provided in vle by my instructer, took some notes and gitprepared for the class. During the class session we formed 4 experts group where we divided the questions into 2 groups each. Our experts group got to discuss about the responsibilities of data administrator.After the discussion, we went to our respective home groups and explained to the other home group members about what we discussed in our experts groups. Then they explained us about different types of database users. Lastly, we shared with the class about what we discussed in the groups.

Though the flipped class gives us an oppurtunity to participate in group discussions and activities, when forming a group, there are some members who takes all the initiatives by themselves and some members who do not engage and lack behind.  I think that for all of us to engage ourselves in the activies, we must be given individual reposibilities within ourselves to facilitate peer-to-peer collaboration and for active engagement. And also the student must be made manditory that they should present to the class at least once for building their cofidence and communication skills.
