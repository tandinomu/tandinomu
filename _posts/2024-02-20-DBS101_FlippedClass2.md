In the second flipped class of DBS101, I learned the fundamentals on Entity Relationship Diagrams. An Entity Relationship Diagram is a graphical representation showing relationships within a system or a database. As the session went on, we learned deeper into the details of ERDs, learning how to identify entities and their attributes, as well as various types of relationships such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. And also, I learned how to draw ERD for a proposed system. 

After the clear and concise explanation of ERD and through engaging examples and hands-on exercises by our instructor, we formed 6 groups with 4 students each and were asked to draw an ERD for a proposed system on a chart. The database system our group got was Bus Booking. We began with analyzing the requirements provided for the database project. For identifying the relevant entities, attributes, and relationships, understanding its domain and context was important as it constituted the foundation of the ERD. With the concept we learned, we drew the primary entities involved, their attributes and interconnections.  We also employed the standard symbols and notation to represent entities as rectangles, attributes as ovals, and relationships as lines connecting entities. After we finished drawing the ERD, we presented it to the class and the others gave us feedback on our ERD. 

Reflecting on the second flipped class on drawing an Entity Relationship Diagram,  I feel that the flipped class went smoothly and effectively without any need for improvement. The clear concepts and explanations before the group work guides us and ensures us that we build on the fundamentals we learn in the session. And also the feedback and consultation  we get while presenting with classmates provides us fresh perspectives and insights that help us concentrate in the class further.
